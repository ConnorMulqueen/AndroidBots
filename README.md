MVP(Minimum Viable Product)

Food Basket is an android app that helps user to share and find any leftover food. A user would be able to take a picture of the food along with a description such as building and room number and share it with others. Other users would be notified of the location and can view the picture the food. Then they will have the ability to vote whether the food is claimed or report as fake.

Add-on Features:

Ability to moderate fraud/fake activities

Users would be able to register an account with the app

Android smart watch compatibility.

Ability to use within a group instead of location. For example to only share location of food or item within a dorm hall.
