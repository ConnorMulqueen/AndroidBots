### Project Description

An android app that helps to find and share leftover food and items with others for free.

**User Story**

"I want free food"

"I have food that nobody wants and I don't want to throw it away."

"I have a chair that I don't need it but it could be useful for someone else."

"There's always leftovers after the event, someone must want it."

**MVP(Minimum Viable Product)**

Food Basket is an android app that helps users share and find any leftover food. A user would be able to snap a picture of the food and share the location along with a description such as building and room number then share it with others. Other users would be notified of the location and can view the picture the food. Then they will have the ability to vote whether the food is claimed or report as fake.


**Add-on Features:**

1. Ability to moderate fraud/fake activities

2. Users would be able to register an account with the app

3. Android smart watch compatibility.

4. Ability to use within a group instead of location. For example to only share location of food or item within a dorm hall.
