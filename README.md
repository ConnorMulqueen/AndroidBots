### Project Description

Food Basket is for free food and items.

Suppose you are at an event and at the end there are pizza slices left. Instead of it going to waste, you can share the food with the community or people near you. Food Basket allows you to snap a picture of the food, then give a description, and location such as building, room number, and quantity. Users nearby will receive a notification of the food and will have the chance to claim it.

- No "half eaten food" meaning no food that someone has taken a bite out; same goes for drinks.

This same process also works with unwanted items such as furniture, books, and more.

**User Story**

"I want free food"

"I have food that nobody wants and I don't want to throw it away."

"I have a chair that I don't need it but it could be useful for someone else."

"There's always leftovers after the event, someone must want it."

**MVP(Minimum Viable Product)**

Food Basket is an android app that helps users share and find any leftover food or items. A user would be able to snap a picture of the food or item and share the location, along with a description such as building and room number. Other nearby users would be notified of the location and can view the picture the food. Then they will have the ability to vote whether the food is claimed or report as fake.

**Add-on Features:**

1. Ability to moderate fraud/fake activities.

2. Users would be able to register an account with the app.

3. Android smart watch compatibility.

4. Ability to use within a group instead or location. For example to only share location of food or item within a dorm hall or with a group of friends.

5. A sell section, able to quickly sell food or items for cash.

6. Food Basket for iOS.

7. Ability to use within a group instead of location. For example to only share location of food or item within a dorm hall.
